# Automated Malware Analysis Platform
## Problem Statement

## Objective:
Build an automated malware analysis platform capable of taking a potentially malicious file, running it in a sandbox environment, analyzing its behavior, and providing valuable insights. This platform should classify malware, identify infection patterns, and offer recommendations for mitigating damage.
## Project Overview
In cybersecurity, analyzing and understanding malicious files is critical for both defending systems and enhancing threat intelligence. Your task is to create a platform that automates this process by:
* Accepting files for analysis.
* Running these files in a secure, isolated (sandbox) environment.
* Analyzing the fileâ€™s behavior during execution.
* Detecting potential malicious patterns, categorizing the malware type, and offering actionable insights.

This system will be a powerful tool for security researchers, analysts, and organizations seeking a proactive defense mechanism against cyber threats.

## Functional Requirements

* File Submission Interface: Create a user interface or API endpoint where users can upload files for analysis.
* Sandbox Environment: Develop a sandbox that can securely execute files and monitor their behavior.
* Behavioral Analysis: Track the file's actions, such as system calls, registry modifications, file changes, network connections, and more.
* Malware Classification: Identify and classify the type of malware (e.g., ransomware, trojan, adware, etc.) based on its behavior patterns.
* Report Generation: Provide a comprehensive report that includes:
    * Detected malicious behavior and infection patterns.
    * Malware classification.
    * Possible infection vectors and impacted areas.
    * Recommendations for mitigating or containing damage.
* Security Measures: Ensure that the sandbox and platform cannot be affected or compromised by the malicious files it analyzes.

## Non-Functional Requirements
* Scalability: The platform should be capable of handling multiple files and concurrent analyses.
* Performance: The sandbox should efficiently analyze files without extensive delays.
* Isolation and Security: Ensure that the sandbox environment is isolated from the main system to prevent accidental infections.
* User-Friendly Interface: The platform should have a clear, intuitive interface for users to submit files and view reports.
